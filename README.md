# Code-Compression-Decompression
C++ code to compress and decompress 32 bit binary instructions. When fed a simple txt file containing the instructions, the program will first create a dictionary then it uses several frequency based compression techniques. The dictionary is a maximum size of 8 32 bit instructions.

Compression techniques include:
  -Run length encoding
  -Bitmasking
  -Dictionary matching
  -1 bit mismatch
  -2 bit consecutive mismatch
  -2 bit mismatch anywhere

This project was completed for an Embedded Systems course at the University of Florida.
